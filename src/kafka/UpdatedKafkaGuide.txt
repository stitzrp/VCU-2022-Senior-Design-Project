1. Install Kafka via https://kafka.apache.org/downloads

2. Extract download: (tar -xzf kafka_2.13-3.0.tgz <— Or whatever version you downloaded)

3. Navigate to folder

3. Run “sh bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties” to start ZooKeeper (used for cluster management).
    May need to run “./gradlew jar -PscalaVersion=2.13.6” first

5. Open another terminal session and run “bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties”

6. Create a topic named 'my-topic' by opening another terminal session and run
    "bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --replication-factor 1 --partitions 10 --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092” <- The number of
    replicators/partitions and the name of the topic can be changed.

7. Create another topic named 'my-topic-output' by opening another terminal session and run
    "bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic my-topic-output --bootstrap-server localhost:9092” <- Again, the number of
    replicators/partitions and the name of the topic can be changed.

8. Compile and run ProducerClient.java and then run App.java

9. Once the ProducerClient and App programs are run, finish by running 'python consumer.py'

EXTRA. Read events by opening another terminal session and run “bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic <TOPIC_NAME> --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092”

EXTRA. Optionally, you can delete any data in your local Kafka environment by running “rm -rf /tmp/kafka-logs /tmp/zookeeper”
